```

load packages
```{r}

library(jsonlite)
```

load data html
```{r}
htmlurl <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinolan/Week-8-Assignment/main/books_html")
x <- readHTMLTable(htmlurl)
df_html<-data.frame(x)
colnames(df_html)<-c("title", "author", "year", "price")
df_html
```

load data xml
```{r}
xmlurl <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinolan/Week-8-Assignment/main/books")
y <- xmlParse(xmlurl)
df_xml <- xmlToDataFrame(y)
df_xml
```

load data json (couldn't get this to work but here is the code i tried to use..)

jsonurl <- getURL("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arinolan/Week-8-Assignment/main/books_json")
df_json <- fromJSON(jsonurl)
df_json



after loading and formating the three different files types, we can see that the dataframes are identical.
